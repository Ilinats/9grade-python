Up to heavenI will guide the world
Jump into the void
I will scream The Word
Forever and ever
I have embraced the flame
Relentlessly
Reflecting endless light
Over and over
I burn a fire of love
Radiantly
I stand in golden rays
I'm in heaven
I will end up dust
I will sing with joy
I dissolve in trust
Forever and ever
Surrender to my will
Endlessly
Take comfort in my skin
Over and over
I slowly lose myself
Silently
Sometimes I slide away
By Depeche Mode
Heaven
